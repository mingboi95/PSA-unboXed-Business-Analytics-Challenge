# PSA-unboXed-Business-Analytics-Challenge
## Analytics Scope

PORTNET® is the first nation-wide business-to-business (B2B) port community solution that empowers the shipping community to easily manage the complexity of cargo operations and the entire shipping process.

It seamlessly handles all electronic vessel and container data passing through PSA Singapore Terminals, the world's largest transhipment hub. Beyond that, its automated system intelligently consolidates and synchronises the transactions and information from every player in the logistics process for an efficient and reliable supply chain.

There are more than 10,000 users, covering various sub-communities. The Haulage Community uses Portnet to achieve the following benefits:

- Automates the Haulage Workflow from job orders to job fulfilment and tracking of incentive payments to drivers

- Improves efficiency for port documentation submissions and job deployment to drivers

- Holistic view of all trucking activities scheduled for each truck

- Instantaneous and round-the-clock access for haulage operations anywhere

- Enhanced business visibility with timely operational reports

We are seeking insights from customer journey analytics to better profile our users through the understanding of their transactional patterns and preferences. This in turn enables us to anticipate their evolving needs and identify areas of improvement for the haulage community to make an informed decision – to deliver more value-add services, improve our business or enhance customer experiences with the haulage community.
